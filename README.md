# Budget Tracker - Online/Offline Functionality

## Description

An application that helps users keep track of their expenses. The app lets users add and subtract funds from their total budget with or without an internet connection. When transactions are entered offline, the app keeps track of them in IndexedDB and once the user is back online, the information is pushed over to MongoDB.

A graph is also included to show the date and expenses that are inputted by the user.
